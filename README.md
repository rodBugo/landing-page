## 💡 Lessons Learned

While creating this landing page, I improved my understanding of CSS and HTML. My struggles with this project was trying to match my landing page to the given image to the pixel even though the requirments mentioned not to. Another struggle came from the hero section, it's a little wider because when I minimize the screen the text and image container overlap with each other but it does look normal in fullscreen.
